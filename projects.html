        <h3>APOCALYPSE SUNGLASSES</h3>
        <p>These sunglasses were designed for a spunky young man who is obsessed with zombies, survival and the active outdoors.
    These glasses will survive the test of an active teenage boy who wants to be stylish while practical.<br><br>

    The design brief was to translate personal preference of a client into a mass-manufacture ready product. Made from
    sturdy vulcanised PMMA with a dash of colour of the metal logo on the temples. Two tints of lenses available to
    suite the gunmetal grey frame and the individual’s style.</p>

        <h3>LUM-ONS LIGHTS</h3>
        <p>This is a fun and interactive mood light that can double up as an emergency light. Designed specifically for the
    South African market during the electricity load shedding spells. Beautifully crafted, this unobtrusive design
    invites a whimsical interaction of light use. Use it on your dinner table, on your patio, as a night light for the
    little ones, during power outages or for general mood lighting.<br><br>


    The base charges the three Lum-Ons wirelessly via magnetic induction. Once charged, the lights can hold charge up to
    4 hours. To switch them on, simply remove them from the base. To switch them off, simply place them back on their
    home base or turn them on their head!<br><br>

    The body and base is made from high grade birch wood, a cast resin top and all kinds of fancy inner-bits. The
    charging base can be charger via a standard cell phone charger plug via USB.</p>

        <h3>LEATHER CELL PHONE WALLET</h3>
        <p>A wallet originally made as a gift which ended up being on order via word of mouth. Small, practical and upcycled
    using off-cut leather and felt. The wallet is ideal for a no-fuss person of minimalistic taste. Using high quality
    off-cut leather means it is durable and will age for as long as one would use the fitting phone.</p>

        <h3>LED LIGHT STRIP</h3>
        <p>This multipurpose LED striplight can be used where-ever perfectly distributed light is needed to accentuate
            products. Slim and sleek with high quality parts and materials to create a lasting luminaire.<br><br>

            The body is made of extruded aluminium, PMMA lens options and over moulded PVS end caps with matching DC
            coaxial power plug. For mounting options there are three options available: a metal end cap bracket, a
            static or rotatable polypropylene bracket, either magnetic or with a self-tapping screw. High functionality
            with an array of LED colours and wattages available to suit every display need.</p>

        <h3>CAPE INSPIRED CERAMIC WINE CARAFE</h3>
        <p>Nothing beats a glass of red wine during winter months. This ceramic wine carafe will help perfectly air your favorite bottle of wine.<br><br>
Inspired by the indigenous flora growing in the Cape Winelands, the carafe’s soft and flowing curves follows that of the Arum Lily along with the iconic emblem of a protea in hand-cut copper. The slender, exposed neck showcases the colour of the wine without spill. <br><br>
The carafe was made using slip-casting techniques and a standard, light coloured glaze that minimally takes away from the colour of the wine. The shape of the carafe allows easy grip to pour, even with a full bottle of wine decanted. <br><br>
Watch this space for more ceramic products coming soon.</p>
